		I love to learn and have fun. Programming has become a hobbie of mine, and I look forward to learning more languages. In my free time, when I am not spending it with friends, I watch tutorials online and try to learn more programming. I really want to work for a good company, doing Software Development, and work on something that will help people making their lives easier.
